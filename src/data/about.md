# Intro

Hello viewers! This is Indupriya, a sophomore, currently pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering at Nit Patna. My interests range from distributed systems, big data to AI and am always eager to explore new technological horizons. In my spare time, I enjoy investing in learning and exploring new technology. I am particularly interested in projects with high social impact. 

# Some history

- My parents put a computer in my bedroom in 2014 when I was 10. It was an old Tandy that ran MS-DOS. My favorite games were Street Rod 2, Wolfenstein 3D, Pokemon go, and Tom and Jerry. It had a mechanical keyboard and a turbo button. To this day, I still don't know what pressing the turbo button really did.

- In the summer of 1996, my uncle purchased [MegaRace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MegaRace) from [Media Play](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_Play) and installed it on my mom's work computer. I might have endangered her business by using her computer too much.

- At 7, I discovered the mini-games hidden in Microsoft Office. I also beat Minesweeper on expert for the first time.

- At 8, my parents bought me a Nexus 7 tablet which turned me into a gadget addict.

- When I was 12, I set the all-time high record at my local laser tag facility by reverse engineering the charging station and weapon protocols with a photo-resistor, micro-cassette recorder, and a lot of patience. I was unstoppable.

- At 13, I went to space camp and fell in love. I went back two more times and promised myself that I'd work in space. I've since helped build three generations of satellites and have contributed to two more.

- At 18, I took my first ALL India exam via which I secured a seat in NIT-P university .

- At 20, I have been typing all above stuff on the website that you are reading now.

Ask me in person for other stories that I'm afraid to share with the internet.
